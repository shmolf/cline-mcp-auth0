# Auth0 MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol server for Auth0 management and configuration analysis.

This TypeScript-based MCP server provides tools and resources for interacting with Auth0 tenants, allowing you to manage applications, analyze configurations, and troubleshoot common Auth0 setup issues.

## Features

### Resources

- **Auth0 Applications** (`auth0://applications`) - List of all Auth0 applications in your tenant
- **Auth0 Tenant Settings** (`auth0://tenant-settings`) - Auth0 tenant configuration and settings

### Tools

- **`get_application`** - Get details of a specific Auth0 application by client ID
  - Parameters: `client_id` (required)
- **`list_applications`** - List all Auth0 applications in the tenant
  - No parameters required
- **`analyze_configuration`** - Analyze Auth0 configuration for common issues
  - Parameters:
    - `webapp_client_id` (required) - Client ID used by the webapp
    - `api_client_id` (optional) - Client ID used by the API
    - `callback_url` (optional) - Expected callback URL
  - Provides detailed analysis of application configuration and identifies common issues
- **`get_tenant_settings`** - Get Auth0 tenant settings and configuration
  - No parameters required

## Prerequisites

You'll need an Auth0 Management API application with the following scopes:

- `read:clients`
- `read:tenant_settings`

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required:

```bash
AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-tenant.auth0.com
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-management-api-client-id
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=your-management-api-client-secret
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=https://your-tenant.auth0.com/api/v2/
```

## Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Build the server:

```bash
npm run build
```

For development with auto-rebuild:

```bash
npm run watch
```

## Installation

To use with Claude Desktop, add the server config:

On MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
On Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "auth0-custom": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/auth0-server/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "AUTH0_DOMAIN": "your-tenant.auth0.com",
        "AUTH0_CLIENT_ID": "your-management-api-client-id",
        "AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET": "your-management-api-client-secret",
        "AUTH0_AUDIENCE": "https://your-api-audience.com"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: The `autoApprove` array allows these tools to run automatically without requiring manual approval each time, which is convenient for read-only operations like listing applications and analyzing configurations.

### Setting up Auth0 Management API

1. Go to your Auth0 Dashboard
2. Navigate to Applications â†’ APIs
3. Select "Auth0 Management API"
4. Go to the "Machine to Machine Applications" tab
5. Authorize your application and grant the required scopes:
   - `read:clients`
   - `read:tenant_settings`

## Usage Examples

Once connected, you can use the server to:

- **List all applications**: Use the `list_applications` tool to get an overview of all Auth0 applications
- **Get specific application details**: Use `get_application` with a client ID to get detailed configuration
- **Analyze configuration issues**: Use `analyze_configuration` to identify common setup problems like:
  - Incorrect application types
  - Missing callback URLs
  - Grant type misconfigurations
  - Shared client IDs between frontend and backend
- **Access tenant settings**: Use `get_tenant_settings` to review tenant-level configuration

## Debugging

Since MCP servers communicate over stdio, debugging can be challenging. We recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector):

```bash
npm run inspector
```

The Inspector will provide a URL to access debugging tools in your browser.

## Error Handling

The server includes comprehensive error handling for:

- Invalid Auth0 credentials
- Network connectivity issues
- Missing applications or resources
- API rate limiting
- Invalid client IDs or configuration parameters

All errors are returned with descriptive messages to help troubleshoot issues.
